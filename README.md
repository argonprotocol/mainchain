# Argon

An inflation-proof stablecoin backed by [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) and the [Ulixee](https://ulixee.org) data
network. The Argon is designed as a transactional
currency that can scale to micropayments as low as 1 millionth of a dollar. It is built on the
Polkadot [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) framework.

## Overview

The Argon mainchain is the stabilization layer of the Argon network. Argon stabilizes the value of the Argon by removing
excess currency from supply when the price of argon falls below target (ie, less is desired by the market) and minting
new supply when price is above target (ie, more is in demand than exists).

Minting can be done through two mechanisms. The first is via mining for the Argon, where miners are given permission to
mint new Argons when the price is above target. The second is through a "Liquid Locking" offering for Bitcoins, where
Bitcoins are able to mint liquidity equal to their Bitcoin's market value by committing to locking their Bitcoins and an
equivalent amount of Argons for a year.

The Bitcoin bonds transform into "options" that allow a holder to profit from the volatility of both the Bitcoin price
and the Argon price. To call an option, a Bitcoin holder must issue a "system burn" of argons equivalent to the current
market price of Bitcoin. This creates a dynamically adjusting "burn rate" to forcefully remove unwanted currency from
the system (unwanted, meaning, the market price of the Argon is below target, ergo less desirable).

The Argon's second layer of excess currency removal (ie, stabilization) occurs through the collection of a tax on
all transactions that occur on the L2 of the Argon network, the Localchains. This second layer tax will dynamically
adjust to the price of the Argon, ensuring sufficient supply can be removed quickly from the system.

Localchains are the person-to-person Layer 2 of the Argon network. They are a personal "blockchain" that keeps a
cryptographic proof of the "current balance" of each user, which can be signed and sent to another user for exchanging
funds. Localchains are expected to be used for high-frequency transactions, such as micropayments for queries in
[Ulixee Datastores](https://ulixee.org/docs/datastore). Localchains submit balance changes in "notarizations" to the
Argon mainchain via Notaries,
which are network approved entities that audit the balance changes and batch them to the mainchain.

## Consensus

The Argon mainchain uses a hybrid consensus model. The first form of consensus is
a [Randomx](https://github.com/tevador/RandomX) proof-of-compute
algorithm that is active during "Slot Zero" before miners register for slots. Randomx was developed as part of the
Monero blockchain to create a proof of work that does not favor GPUs, allowing regular desktops to compete. The argon
has no funds minted in the genesis block, so this period can be viewed as the bootstrapping period for the network.

The second form of consensus is a registered mining phase, where miners bid for slots to mine blocks. They must bid for
a slot. Vaults can win a prorata of this bid pool by creating BondedBitcoins, which are issued equal to the amount of
LockedBitcoin they have confirmed. Because it is expected that mining auctions will be near the expected earnings,
Vaults are incented to bring new bitcoin liquidity into the system to compete on their prorata share. Miners are given
priority to register blocks in the system over proof of compute blocks, so once this phase activates, the network will
be secured by the miners and only use proof of compute when no miners are registered or active. Miners are matched to
votes provided by Localchain users using an XOR closest
algorithm (more details to come in the whitepaper).

## Technology Brief

The Argon mainchain is built using the [Substrate](https://substrate.dev) framework. Substrate is a modular blockchain
framework that allows developers to build custom blockchains that operate independently, but can connect into a shared
ecosystem called "Parachains". Substrate is built in Rust and has a WebAssembly runtime that allows for upgrades to the
blockchain without forks. Argon runs as a "solochain", which means our consensus is not shared with other chains.

Cross-chain transfers are enabled via [Hyperbridge](https://hyperbridge.network), which is a zero-trust, decentralized
bridge. Fees are payable in Argons when going Argon -> Ethereum/Base/Binance Chain/etc, and the native token of a source
chain when transferring into Argon.

A Uniswap liquidity pool with USDC is used to create a price-point for the Argon. The main Uniswap contract initially in
use is on Ethereum.

The Localchain is a Rust library that can be run in a standalone cli, within Node.js via bindings created
using [napi-rs](https://napi.rs) or as a library in iOS/Android using [uniffi](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs). It
uses a Sqlite database to store the balance changes and notarizations.

The Notary is a Rust-based API that uses Json-RPC to communicate with the Localchains and the Argon mainchain. It uses a
PostgresSQL database to keep track of its history and users' balance tips.

## Repository Structure

- `bitcoin`: This module has a cli for bitcoin bonds and vaults, and shared code around the Bitcoin miniscript used for
  the vaulted bitcoins.
- `client`: Mainchain client library in rust and for nodejs.
- `end-to-end`: Tests intending to be run using the end-user tools.
- `localchain`: Localchain is the layer 2 of Argon run by individual wallets. This repo includes bindings for nodejs, a
  standalone cli, and code to run the localchain inside iOS/Android. More about the
  localchain [here](./docs/localchain.md).
- `node`: The node implementation is the entry point for the Argon blockchain. It is responsible for networking,
  consensus, and running the blockchain.
  - `randomx`: Argon has two forms of block consensus. The first is a randomx proof-of-work algorithm. It is eligible
    for creating all blocks during "Slot 0", before miners register for slots.
  - `consensus`: The second form of consensus comes from votes submitted by localchains to the notaries. This module
    has logic for retrieving notebooks from notaries and prioritizing blocks.
  - `bitcoin_utxo_tracker`: Each block created and validated by the Argon blockchain must track all Bitcoin UTXOs that
    back the Argon via bonds. This is done by tracking BlockFilters in bitcoin against the bonded UTXOs.
- `notary`: The notary validates localchain transactions and confirms they are operating on their latest tip. A notary
  runs on a Postgres database. It must submit notebooks rolling up all the localchain balance changes, votes and
  registered domains. Notebooks are submitted for each system "tick".
- `runtime`: The runtime implementation is the core logic of the blockchain. It defines the state transition function
  and the blockchain's logic. The runtime is built as a wasm binary and can be upgraded without a hard fork.
- `oracle`: The code for running the oracles that submit price data and the bitcoin confirmed tip to the blockchain.
- `pallets`: The pallets are the various "tables" that make up the blockchain. They define the storage, dispatchables,
  events, and errors of the blockchain.
  - `bitcoin_utxos`: Tracks the Bitcoin UTXOs that back the Argon.
  - `block_rewards`: Allocates and unlocks block rewards (they are frozen for a period before being allowed to be
    spent).
  - `block_seal`: Verifies the type of block seal used to secure the blockchain matches eligible work.
  - `block_seal_spec`: Tracks and adjust difficulty of compute and vote "power" for block seals.
  - `bitcoin_locks`: Allows users to lock and unlock bitcoins.
  - `chain_transfer`: Allows users to transfer Argon between chains. Currently supports Localchain and Mainchain.
  - `domains`: Registers and tracks domains. Domains are used to establish micropayment channel holds with ip routing
    akin to a dns lookup. They're prominently used for [Ulixee Datastores](https://ulixee.org/docs/datastore).
  - `mining_slot`: Allows users to register for mining slots. Mining slots are used to determine who is eligible to
    mine blocks created by the notebook commit reveal scheme.
  - `mint`: Mints Argons to locked bitcoins and miners when the Argon price is above target
  - `notaries`: Registers the notaries and metadata to connect to them
  - `notebook`: Tracks the recent notebooks submitted by the notaries, as well as the account change roots for each
    notebook. Also tracks the last changed notebook per localchain.
  - `price_index`: Tracks Argon-USD and Bitcoin USD pricing, as well as the current Argon Target price given CPI
    inflation since the starting time.
  - `ticks`: Tracks system-wide "ticks" or minutes since genesis as whole units.
  - `vaults`: Register and manage vaults that offer LockedBitcoins to bitcoin holders and use BondedBitcoins to earn a
    pro rata of the Mining Slot bid pool.
- `primitives`: Shared models and types for the Argon mainchain, localchain and notaries.

## Runtime Pallets

Argon makes use of a few runtime pallets that are useful to know about as a user of the system.

- `Balances`: This is an instance of
  the [balances](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html) pallet that is used to
  track the
  balances of the Argon
  currency. NOTE: balances are stored in the System Account, not the pallet. This can make some api calls confusing.
- `Ownership`: This is an instance of
  the [balances](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_balances/index.html) pallet that is used to
  track the Ownership Tokens
  of an account. Ownership tokens allow you to bid on mining slots.
- `Grandpa`: Argon uses the [Grandpa](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf) Finality gadget to
  finalize blocks. This pallet is used to track the finality authorities (which correspond to the active miners) and
  equivocations (which are penalties for not following grandpa rules).
- `Multisig`: This [pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_multisig/index.html) allows you to
  create a multi-signature account. Substrate's multisig is a little different from other systems, as it requires each
  party to submit their portion of the signature in a separate transaction.
- `Proxy`: This [pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/pallet_proxy/index.html) allows you to create
  a proxy account that can submit transactions on behalf of another account. This is useful for creating a cold wallet
  that can still submit transactions. The cold wallet will pay for the transaction fees but doesn't have to have keys
  loaded into memory.
- `Hyperbridge`. There are several pallets involved (`ismp`, `ismp_grandpa`, `hyperbridge`, `token_gateway`) here to
  activate the Argon ability to move tokens cross-chain. Learn more about
  hyperbridge [here](https://hyperbridge.network).

## Experimental Mainnet

Argon has an experimental Mainnet. Experimental here means it is persistent long term, but not yet in a fully
stable/secure state. It's ready to test technically and economically with small amounts of value and connected to live
Ethereum, Bitcoin, Base, and several other EVM chains.
