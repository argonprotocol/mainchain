This is a Node.js client for the Argon Protocol (https://argonprotocol.org). It is mostly autogenerated from the
polkadot.js api (https://polkadot.js.org/api/).

## Usage

To create a client, you can use the `getClient(host)` function in the main module. This will return a client object that
is typed to the argon apis.

## Wage Protector

If you want to protect wages against inflation or deflation of the Argon, there is a `WageProtector` class that can be
used. You can use it a single time:

```javascript
const {WageProtector} = require('@argonprotocol/mainchain');
const basePrice = 1_000_000n; // 1 Argon
const protector = await WageProtector.create(client);
const protectedPrice = protector.getProtectedWage(basePrice);
```

Or you can subscribe to changes (for instance, to track a series of valid cpi adjustments):

```javascript

const {WageProtector} = require('@argonprotocol/mainchain');
const basePrice = 1_000_000n; // 1 Argon
const {unsubscribe} = await WageProtector.subscribe(client, (protectedPrice) => {
    console.log(`Protected price: ${protectedPrice.getProtectedWage(basePrice)}`);
});
```

Each `WageProtector` instance has the details of the Argon Target Price and USD price at the time of creation.

```typescript

interface IArgonCpiSnapshot {
    // The target price of the argon as a fixed point number (18 decimals)
    argonUsdTargetPrice: bigint;
    // The current price of the argon as a fixed point number (18 decimals)
    argonUsdPrice: bigint;
    // The block hash in which the cpi was finalized
    finalizedBlock: Uint8Array;
    // The tick that the cpi applies to
    tick: bigint;
}
```
